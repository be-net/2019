If you submit an abstract for a talk or a poster you will be automatically registered. This is not automatic for the co-authors, so they should register separately. Also, if you submitted something, but for any reason you don't plan to attend anymore, please send us an email with subject [BeNet2019 cancellation]

# Registration

Registration is **free**. Nonetheless the space is limited. Preference will be given to people presenting some work, and promotion of diversity will be a criterion of choice.
Please register by **15.02.2019**.
For those who don't plan to submit a oral/poster contribution,
you can register by simply sending an *empty* abstract with the
word `[REGISTRATION].`
